# Empirical Evaluation

This directory contains the artifacts related to the **systematic evaluation** of environmental flakiness in JavaScript projects.  
For each project, tests were executed across multiple environments, operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) and Node.js versions (18, 20, 22), to investigate whether changes in the execution environment can lead to flaky behavior.
